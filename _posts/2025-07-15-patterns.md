title: Can patterns create dot products?

Back when I created the [plains]() and [forest]() styles, I put a lot of effort into the creation of randomly placed dot features from interference filters. The whole process revolved around thresholding tiny spikes within inference cloud patterns. Since different browsers take different approaches to resolve inference clouds, the resulting dots were not reliably visible on all platforms. As enticing as such random patterns are, I have realized that they are not required for dot placement within this project (kind of continuing my thoughts from the [swamp post]()). Sufficiently large svg patterns allow us to accuratly match dot placement and can also handle the little groupings of dots that frequently occur.

So in this post we'll revisit the terrains that required dot placement so far and also tackle those that will need dots and more complex patterns. This includes the various types of deserts and badlands.

Some features, particularly tributary rivers, were listed in source books as "unnamed" but there might be some names that eluded me during my search. So this is where I am setting out a call for help (mostly to other redditors). Below is a version of the raw data svg with all nameless features marked in red. If you know the name for any of them or at least know where I might find it I would appreciate a message to [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forgotten_Realms/comments/1llpjvh/looking_for_geographic_feature_names_in_3e_faer%C3%BBn/) or a PM to [u/the_domokun](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=the_domokun).

But with at least the shape data collection complete, I can return to making it look like 3e in the next post.
