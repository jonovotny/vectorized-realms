"Cleared/Mix" (which i like to call "plains" for simplicity) is the default style for land areas on the Faerun map. Only some of the smallest islands avoid using this style, though arguably it is still present below the native terrain of e.g. the frozen isles of the Sea of Moving Ice. Visually, plains are made up of two main elements: the beige background with its
faint dark beige color blots and the randomly placed dots covering the area.
