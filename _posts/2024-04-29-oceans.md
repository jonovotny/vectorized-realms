Let's start from the bottom with the "oceans" style, which contains all large bodies of water. From a visual perspective, this style is relatively simple and made up of four different elements that we need to replicate with SVG styles:

# Deep sea 

# Continental shelf

# Coastal shelf

# Coastline
