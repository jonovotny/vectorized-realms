Now that we know what we need to draw the [mountain terrain](/vectorized-realms/mountains/) it's time to think about how we can to generate all the required "extra" shapes with minimal user input. There are, after all, a lot of mountains on the map and having to draw flank lines and shaded sides by hand would be a massive time sink. It also would increase the effort of changing mountain geometry slater on.

There are three tasks at hand:

* Identify continous flank-ridgline sections and place smooth flank lines roughly in the middle between them.
* Create a mask for these flanklines using the entire flank section with an inset hole on the bright sides.
* Created shapes for the shadowed flank sections.

It is finally time to tackle the most visually complex terrain type of the 3e map, mountains. The peaks of Faerun are made up of three image components; the outline, which confines the mountains background color, the main ridge line, separating the illuminated from the shadowed side of the mountain, and the (somewhat) orthogonal flank lines, which connect ridge and outline. It's the latter that will be the most difficult to approximate, even for simple mountains.

This terrain has a few added twists that make things even harder. A mountain's background color is influenced by the surrounding terrain, e.g. mountains in forests and jungles might have a greenish tint, while mountains on glaciers sport a white-gray palette. Tall mountains feature white snow areas around their main ridge lines, while volcanoes interrupt the ridge to indicate active craters. Finally, the main ridges may sometimes branch, creating entire side mountains. All of these are special cases that our svg style needs to handle (or at least roughly approximate).


As described in the previous [post](/vectorized-realms/mountains/), we now have access to a programmable svg parser/generator, that we can use to automatically create intermediate features. I will use it to reduce the amount of vector information needed to create visual mountain representations. The idea is to only define outline and ridgeline (with some extra points), and use this data to automatically create all the finer details of the mountain. Before the automatization, let's go over the general concept with a manual example, specifically the Troll Mountains in the east of Amn. We start with the general outline of the mountain area and the branching ridgelines (slightly smooth-filtered to fit with the rest of the map styles):

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonovotny/vectorized-realms/refs/heads/gh-pages/svg/24-07-23-mountains/mountains-outline.png" width=300px/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonovotny/vectorized-realms/refs/heads/gh-pages/svg/24-07-23-mountains/mountains-target.png" width=300px/>

This representation looks obviously completely flat, compared to the original image which uses different color and line features to seperate illuminated flanks of the mountain from shadowed ones. The "sun" is located in northeast of the map, so we need to shadow any flanks facing in south and west direction. Branching ridges and steep turns can sometimes introduce a change of lighting within a continuous mountain flank, the Troll Mountains would be split into 6 coloring reagions:

If we add some darker shading and blur to the shadowed regions, the visualization gets a lot more "depth". If we only consider shading changes by branching ridgelines, we can calculate how many seperate regions of each color will be present in a single mountain. A simple linear mountain encompasses two flanks, one bright one dark. Every side branch generally creates two more regions of each type. (There are very few cases in which a sidebranch has the same shadings on both of its sides, e.g. the Snout of Omgar in Samarach, but we will ignore those for now).

# Flank lines

With the basic coloring solved we can look at the finer details, i.e. the flank lines. The "brute force" approach to create them would be to draw each individual line as an svg path. This would allow us to recreate the 3e style with very high accuracy, but automatic generation would be difficult and it would massively increase the file size of the map. 

If we give up on some visual fidelity, we can use a few tricks to approximate flank lines with fewer geometric elements. Looking at the lines present on a single flank we observe that they are relatively straight lines (with some jitter), often nearly parallel to each other, and roughly orthogonal to a smoothed out ridgeline. Rather than treating them as individual paths, we can treat the entire set of flank lines as a single wide line with many breaks to form individual straight segments. We can place this stippled spline curve in the middle of flank, so that it covers the entire area while following the shape of the ridge:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonovotny/vectorized-realms/refs/heads/gh-pages/svg/24-07-23-mountains/mountains-stippled.png" width=300px/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonovotny/vectorized-realms/refs/heads/gh-pages/svg/24-07-23-mountains/mountains-target.png" width=300px/>

This trick has some limitations, the main one being that the stippled sections are not lines with a continuous thickness, but polygons with a different width at each end. If the flank is realtively straight, these width differences are hardly noticeable. At thight curves, however, the sides of stippled sections tend to diverge like a wedge on one side and cross over with each other on the other side. This effectively limits how wide of a line we can use for this and how tight turns can be. It also can not replicate situations where flank lines are not orthogonal to the ridge for extended lengths. 

Still, this method is good enough to move forward with it for now. The initial example shows that the stippled line has a fixed width and is wide enough to cover the entire mountain flank. We can use mask shapes based on blurred flank polygons to cut away any overshooting lines:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonovotny/vectorized-realms/refs/heads/gh-pages/svg/24-07-23-mountains/mountains-masked.png" width=300px/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonovotny/vectorized-realms/refs/heads/gh-pages/svg/24-07-23-mountains/mountains-target.png" width=300px/>

The illuminated areas of the flank additionally have breaks in the flank lines right at the center of the flanks. We can reproduce this by using different 


So we now have a concept on how to draw mountains. However, it is reliant on a lot of geometric objects that have some overlap. Since it would be cumbersome to create all these objects manually, we will have to come up with a way to automate this process. But that is a story for part 2.
