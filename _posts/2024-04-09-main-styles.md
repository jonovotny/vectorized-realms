To start, we can group the different area types shown on the map based on similarities of their drawing styles. The legend of the map is a helpful indicator which styles need to be covered (though it does not include every style present on the map).

Oceans form the bottom layer of the map and are fortunately not a very coomplicated style. They start at a solid blue coastline, being light blue very close to the coast, slightly darker blue on a continental shelf and dark blue in the deep sea.
Coastal water regions can be generated based on the outline path of the continent, but the continental shelf will require a separate path due to it's varying distance from the coastline. Fortunately, the gradient from coastal to shelf waters is wide, so it can be approximated with a coarser path and then smoothed over.

Plains (or "Cleared Land" in the legend) are the baige-colored default style for land masses on the map. Visually, it is a mix of random dark-beige blots on a beige background and some random tiny dots. Both of these effects can be generated by applying turbulence/fractalNoise filters of svg objects.
