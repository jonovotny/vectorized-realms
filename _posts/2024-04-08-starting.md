title: Starting to vectorize the Realms

I have decided that a small blog is a better way to keep track of progress than the [repo's wiki page](https://github.com/jonovotny/vectorized-realms/wiki).

So welcome to my hobby project to create a vector map of Faerun (possibly extended to Toril) during the time of D&D 3.5e (~1376 DR).
My approach is to approximate the iconic drawing style of the [official 2001 map](http://web.archive.org/web/20160816135344/http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/images/wd_maps/FRposterLarge_150.jpg) using a combination of svg path generation scripts and filters and then apply them on an svg map, containing only the outlines of geographic regions.

Ideally this should have the following benefits:
* Simple Editing: Changing existing features of the map or adding new ones can be done in an SVG editor.
* High Quality Zoom: SVG enables creation of detail maps without getting pixelated results.
* Merging of Different Sources: Detail maps of specific maps exist and the vector format should aid in the combination of different map sources.
* GeoJson, TopoJson output: Vector data can be used in online map interfaces like [Open Layers](https://openlayers.org/)
