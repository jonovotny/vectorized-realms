Now that we have some of the basic terrain types covered, it is also time to think how to combine data sources and view them efficiently. On the data end I have started to trace terrain types from the 2001 3e map to gain complete paths for oceans, lakes, plains/grasslands, and jungles/forests. This map is limited to the continent of Faerun and since a complete world map is a goal down the line we need to place it on the globe. Fortunately, Toril is about the same size as earth (see [Dragon Magazine #161, pg 89](https://annarchive.com/files/Drmg161.pdf)) so current geo information systems can help us out. D&D 5e did not include a complete world map, so the best base map is to my knowledge still the one published in the Forgotten Realms Interactive Atlas. The 2D map of the atlas is not complete in the north and south directions and ommits latitude and longitude lines, but it does come with an interactive globe that we can use to place it on the right spot:

Marked are two critical spots I picked to line up the maps latitudes: the island north of Icewind Dale at 60Â° North and the Corsair Domain islands at the Equator. Many adventures play on the sword coast, so getting this part of the map "correctly" placed seems sensible. Even within the interactive atlas, some map regions don't line up. Along the equator, for example, on the globe Maztica is placed further south than on the 2D map (though since those regions are hardly explored, poor maps are to be expected). With that information, we can attempt to add a lat/long graticule to the world map:

While designed as real world google maps-like interface, [open layers](https://openlayers.org/) can just as well handle fictional D&D campaign maps. Though when it comes to svg files, complicated sets of filters seem to cause performance and rendering issues.
